# NewsTrendsAnalytics


A) Basic Model : Use data features after preprocessing


B) Rank Based Model: Considers popularity of one news item affecting share value of other news items.

C) Dimension Reductionality + Rank Model - Dimensionality reduction used along with the rank model for prediction.

D) Under Sampling + Dimension Reductionality + Rank Model - added under sampling for the news item with 0 shares as there were very high number of such items.

E) Time Series Based -  Used Recurrentmd Neural Network LSTM cells.
